              <br>
              <p>Wilpattu National Park (Sinhala: ‡∑Ä‡∑í‡∂Ω‡∑ä‡∂¥‡∂≠‡∑ä‡∂≠‡∑î ‡∂¢‡∑è‡∂≠‡∑í‡∂ö ‡∑Ä‡∂±‡∑ù‡∂Ø‡∑ä‚Äç‡∂∫‡∑è‡∂±‡∂∫) is a national park in Sri Lanka. The unique feature of this park is the existence of "Willus" (natural lakes) ‚Äì natural, sand-rimmed water basins or depressions that fill with rainwater.
                 Located on the northwest coast lowland dry zone of Sri Lanka, the park is 30 km (19 mi) west of Anuradhapura and 26 km (16 mi) north of Puttalam (approximately 180 km (110 mi) north of Colombo). 
                The park is 1,317 km2 (508 sq mi) (131,693 hectares) in area and ranges from 0‚Äì152 m (0‚Äì499 ft) above sea level. 
                Nearly one hundred and six lakes (Willu) and tanks are found spread throughout Wilpattu.
                 Wilpattu is the largest and one of the oldest national parks in Sri Lanka.
                 Wilpattu is world-renowned for its leopard (Panthera pardus kotiya) population.
                 A remote camera survey conducted in Wilpattu from July to October 2015 by the Wilderness and Wildlife Conservation Trust captured photographs of forty-nine individual leopards in the surveyed area, the core area density of which was between that of Yala National Park's Block I and Horton Plains National Park.<br><br>
                 From December 1988 to 16 March 2003, the park was closed due to security concerns surrounding the Sri Lankan Civil War, before being reopened to visitors sixteen years later. Visitor access is currently limited to approximately 25% of the park, the remainder of which is dense forest or scrub.
                  Popular visiting periods span between the months of February and October, although there are a number of private ecotourism groups that conduct safaris year-round.<br><br>
                  The annual Rainfall is about 1,000 mm (39 in) and the annual temperature is about 27.2 ¬∞C (81.0 ¬∞F). Inter-monsoonal rains in March and the northeast monsoon (December ‚Äì February) are the main sources of rainfall.</p>

    <h1 class="headings12">Best Time to Visit Wilpattu National Park</h1>


        <div id="image02">

          <div id="explain02">
            <br>
            <p>Wilpattu is a year-round destination and a great place to explore at any time.

              However, the best time to visit Wilpattu National Park is from May until early October.
               This is the dry season in northwestern Sri Lanka, which creates perfect conditions for spotting animals.<br><br>
               During these months, the animals tend to gather around the park‚Äôs many natural lakes and other watering holes making them easier to spot.

               Additionally, given the lack of rainfall during these months, the vegetation is less dense making it easier to see animals from further away.
               
               May‚ÄìJuly is the best time to see Sri Lankan sloth bears in Wilpattu.
                These are the months when the park‚Äôs palu trees produce their fruit, which is the bears‚Äô favourite food.
               
               If you visit during the wet season (late October‚ÄìFebruary), you should be prepared for some heavy rain.
                Some of the park‚Äôs roads and tracks can become impassable, which can restrict the areas that you‚Äôre able to visit.
               
               That said, these are the best months to visit Wilpattu for birdwatching.
                Many species of migratory birds flock here from all over Europe and Northern Asia to escape the cold winter, including pintails, plovers, sandpipers, and terns.</p>
