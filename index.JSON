  "description": "The Sri Lankan leopard, an endangered, endemic sub-species, is the islandâ€™s apex predator. This sub species is native to the island and has made a leopard safari Sri Lanka much sought after. These Sri Lankan cats possess a tawny or rusty yellow-coloured coat with close-set rosettes and dark spots. Females of this subspecies weigh around 29 kg, and males weigh around 56 kg. The Sri Lankan leopard has historically been found across a wide range of habitats on the island nation including arid scrub jungle, rainforest, upper highland forest, and dry evergreen monsoon forest."
