        <p>Known as the ‚ÄòLord of the Jungle‚Äô, the Sri Lankan Leopard (Panthera parades kotiya) is one of the eight recognized subspecies of Leopard and is indigenous to Sri Lanka. The Sri Lankan Leopard, the smallest of the ‚ÄòBig cats‚Äô is still the only large mammal predator in the country and relatively bigger in size than its relatives living elsewhere. It is rusty yellow coloured with its characteristic dark spots and lithe elongated bodies. It is stocky in build, with a shoulder height of about 45 to 80 centimeters with males weighing around 56 kg and females around 29 kg and lives up o 20 years. They are highly graceful and agile animals are predatory carnivores making them excellent hunters who pursue different prey such as small mammals, birds, reptiles, wild boar, sambur and barking-deer of which the spotted deer makes a larger part of its diet. They hunt mainly during the nights and are best observed during dawn and dusk and sometimes during the daytime as well.</p>

              <p>Kumana National Park is located in Eastern part of Yala National park holds its own as a bird sanctuary at the same time being home to some of the larger mammals found in Yala west park.
                 Kumana has its large estuary called "Kumbukkan Oya". These estuary mangroves are largely used by migratory and residents birds to build nests and raise their young.<br><br>
                 Sightings of changeable hawk eagles, painted and rare black necked storks, egrets, godwits, ibis and many more are possible by the many lagoons. When you are on wildlife safari in Kumana National Park watch out for elephants, spotted, and sambhur deer and of course the magnificent leopard. You will have to have keen eyes to spot the leopards lying in the undergrowth of the forest. They too are quite active around watering holes like the Kumana Villu swamp.
                 Sometimes if you are lucky you will find one or twoleopards cross the roads in front of your safari jeeps as they hunt for their next meal. </p><br>

              <p>The Veheragala National Park, also known as Yala Block 5 became popular in the last 6 years as an alternative to Yala Block 5.
                 The small land extends borders to the giant Veheragala reservoir and is less visited than its more famous counterpart. This park is also known for its fair number of leopards, often seen on the main road which runs through the park.
                 The high density of prey animals such as Spotted Deer and Grey Langur may have resulted in the number of leopards seen, and gradual habituation has helped greatly in giving quality sightings.  </p><br>

              <p>The misty highlands of Sri Lanka is hardly a place one would imagine encountering a leopard.
                 But despite this, historically, the highlands are where most of the island forests are covered, it was and where most of the wildlife animals roamed.
                 With the onset of the British taking over the country, they cleared these vast forests to grow Coffee and subsequently Tea.<br><br> 
                 One of the last remaining highland wilderness refuges is Horton Plains, National Park.
                  Located over 2500 meters above sea level, this montane wilderness is set atop a high plateau and is one of Mother Nature‚Äôs most spectacular wonders. </p><br>

              <h2>Threats and Conservation</h2>
              <br>
              <p>The Sri Lankan Leopard is rapidly declining due to habitat loss and fragmentation, and hunting for trade and due to pest control.
                 Skins and canines are widely traded in Sri Lanka, as the canine is worn as a talisman by some village folks as it is said to bring about good fortune, while certain parts of the animal is eaten or applied to traditional medicine.<br><br>
                 On a global context the leopard is classified as Near Threatened by the IUCN and is listed on CITES (Convention in the Trade in Endangered Species): Appendix I. the Sri Lankan Leopard is classified as Endangered due to habitat loss and poaching. 
                 There are records of over six specimens of leopards being poached in areas around national parks.<br><br>
                 Sri Lanka has one record of a man eater, the man eater of Punanai, which has been accredited for killing nearly 15 individuals, before finally being laid to rest by Edgar, who killed the animal by waiting in ambush.
                  This is documented in Christopher Ondaatje‚Äôs award winning tale ‚ÄòThe Man-Eater of Punanai‚Äô. </p>
