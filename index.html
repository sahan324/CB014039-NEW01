            <p>The Sri Lankan leopard, an endangered, endemic sub-species, is the island‚Äôs apex predator. 
            This sub species is native to the island and has made a leopard safari Sri Lanka much sought after. These Sri Lankan cats possess a tawny or rusty yellow-coloured coat with close-set rosettes and dark spots. Females of this subspecies weigh around 29 kg, and males weigh around 56 kg.
            The Sri Lankan leopard has historically been found across a wide range of habitats on the island nation including arid scrub jungle, rainforest, upper highland forest, and dry evergreen monsoon forest. </p><br>

            <p>Wild chickenlike bird. Male is burnt orange with dark streaks, cockerel-like glossy black tail, and a prominent red comb marked with yellow on the crown.
            Gray-brown female has white streaks and prominent barring on its wings. Terrestrial, found in pairs or small groups in forests of lowlands and highlands over much of Sri Lanka. Generally keeps to cover.
            Only confusion is with domestic chicken; note lack of white at tail base, and yellow marking on comb of males, and bars in wings of females in Sri Lanka Junglefowl.  </p><br>
