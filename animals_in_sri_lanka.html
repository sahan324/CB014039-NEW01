        <h2><span>Animals </span>In <span>Sri Lanka</span></h2>
        <p>The wildlife in Sri Lanka is vast and includes various plant and animal species.
           Sri Lanka has many protected areas that aid in conserving these species, many of which are scarce and endangered.
            The country has a tropical climate with a lot of yearly rainfall. Hence, the wildlife found here are mostly species used in tropical climates. 
            The various national parks in Sri Lanka are the best places to witness these beautiful creatures in their wild habitats.</p>

              <br>
              <p>The Crested Porcupine is blackish brown and white with a cloak of pointed quills.
                 Many predators are seen with these quills in their flesh for long times after a failed attack on the Porcupine.<br><br>
                 The Indian crested porcupine is a large rodent, weighing 11‚Äì18 kg (24‚Äì40 lb).
                  Their body (from the nose to the base of the tail) measures between 70 and 90 cm (28 and 35 in) with the tail adding an additional 8‚Äì10 cm (3.1‚Äì3.9 in).
                  The lifespan of an Indian crested porcupines in the wild is unknown, however, the oldest known Indian crested porcupine in captivity was female; and lived up to be 27.1 years old.<br><br>
                  It is covered in multiple layers of modified hair called quills, with longer, thinner quills covering a layer of shorter, thicker ones.The quills are brown or black with alternating white and black bands.
                   They are made of keratin and are relatively flexible.
                   Each quill is connected to a muscle at its base, allowing the porcupine to raise its quills when it feels threatened.
                   The longest quills are located on the neck and shoulder, where the quills form a "skirt" around the animal.
                   These quills can grow up to 51 cm (20 in) long, with most measuring between 15 and 30 cm (5.9 and 11.8 in).
                   Smaller (20 cm) and more rigid quills are packed densely on the back and rump.
                  These smaller quills are used to stab at potential threats.
                   The base of the tail contains shorter quills that appear white in color, with longer, hollow quills that the porcupine can rattle to produce a warning sound when threatened.
                   Contrary to popular belief, Indian crested porcupines (like all porcupines) cannot shoot their quills.<br><br>

    <h1 class="headings10">Sri Lankan Junglefowl</h1>
    
    
        <div id="image">

          <div id="explain">
            <br>
            <p>The Sri Lankan junglefowl (Gallus lafayettii sometimes spelled Gallus lafayetii), also known as the Ceylon junglefowl or Lafayette's junglefowl, is a member of the Galliformes bird order which is endemic to Sri Lanka, where it is the national bird.
               It is closely related to the red junglefowl (G. gallus), the wild junglefowl from which the chicken was domesticated. However, a whole-genome molecular study rather show that Sri Lankan junglefowl and grey junglefowl are genetically closer species than the red junglefowl.
               Sri Lankan junglefowl and red junglefowl diverged about 2.8 million years ago, whereas time of divergence between the Sri Lankan junglefowl and grey junglefowl was 1.8 million years ago. <br><br>
               As with other junglefowl, the Sri Lankan junglefowl is strongly sexually dimorphic; the male is much larger than the female, with more vivid plumage and a highly exaggerated wattle and comb.

               The male Sri Lankan junglefowl ranges from 66‚Äì72 cm (26‚Äì28 in) in length and 790‚Äì1,140 g (1.74‚Äì2.51 lb) in weight, essentially resembling a large, muscular rooster.
                The male has orange-red body plumage, and dark purple to black wings and tail. 
               The feathers of the mane descending from head to base of spine are golden, and the face has bare red skin and wattles.
                The comb is red with a yellow centre.<br><br>
                As with other jungle fowl, Sri Lankan jungle fowl are primarily terrestrial. They spend most of their time foraging for food by scratching the ground for various seeds, fallen fruit, and insects.

                Females lay two to four eggs in a nest, either on the forest floor in steep hill country or in the abandoned nests of other birds and squirrels.
                 Like the grey and green junglefowl, male Sri Lankan junglefowl play an active role in nest protection and chick rearing.</p>

            <br>
            <p>The purple-faced langur (Semnopithecus vetulus), also known as the purple-faced leaf monkey, is a species of Old World monkey that is endemic to Sri Lanka. The animal is a long-tailed arboreal species, identified by a mostly brown appearance, dark face (with paler lower face) and a very shy nature. 
              The species was once highly prevalent, found in suburban Colombo and the "wet zone" villages (areas with high temperatures and high humidity throughout the year, whilst rain deluges occur during the monsoon seasons), but rapid urbanization has led to a significant decrease in the population level of the monkeys.
               It had traditionally been classified within the genus Trachypithecus but was moved to the genus Semnopithecus based on DNA evidence indicating that is it more closely related to the gray langurs<br><br>
               n the purple-faced langur, males are usually larger than females. Males measure 50 to 67.1 cm (19.7 to 26.4 in) in head-body length with a tail of 67 to 85.1 cm (26.4 to 33.5 in). Females possess a head-body length 44.7 to 60 cm (17.6 to 23.6 in) and tail length of 58.9 to 82 cm (23.2 to 32.3 in). The pelage may generally vary from blackish to grayish.
                The species tends to have whitish to gray short 'trousers' rounded off by purplish-black faces with white sideburns.
                Part of the back is covered with whitish fur, and tail is also furred with black and white mixed colors.
                The feet and hands are also purplish-black in color.
                Size varies among the subspecies. 
               Typically adults will weigh somewhere between 3.1 and 11.4 kg (6.8 and 25.1 lb), averaging about 7.08 kg (15.6 lb).
                The smallest subspecies (S. v. nestor) commonly weighs between 3.8 and 6 kg (8.4 and 13.2 lb).
               Average weight from other subspecies has been recorded up to 7.8 kg (17 lb) in females and 8.5 kg (19 lb) in males with some exceptionally big langurs weighing up to perhaps 18 kg (40 lb). Among the primates that live in Sri Lanka, it is somewhat smaller than the tufted gray langur despite leading males of the group of purple-faced langurs often being larger than the tufted gray langur that lived together in the habitats.
                In the subspecies known as the "bear monkey" (S. v. monitcola) usually has a darker coat and usually sports a heavy mustache.
                In this species, the hair of crown directed backwards throughout, not radiating. 
               it lacks the crest of tufted gray langurs and has hair on the crown no longer than on temples and nape.
                Purple-faced langurs have a rump that is pure white or whitish gray.</p>

            <p>Yala (‡∂∫‡∑è‡∂Ω) National Park is the most visited and second largest national park in Sri Lanka, bordering the Indian Ocean. The park consists of five blocks, three of which are now open to the public. 
              There are also two adjoining parks, Kumana National Park or 'Yala East' and Lunugamvehera National Park. 
              The blocks have individual names, such as Palatupana (Block 1).
               It is situated in the southeastern region of the country, in the Southern Province and Uva Province.
               The park covers 979 square kilometres (378 sq mi) and is located about 300 kilometres (190 mi) from Colombo. 
              Yala was designated as a wildlife sanctuary in 1900, along with Wilpattu, designated in 1938, as the first two designated national parks in Sri Lanka.
               The park is best known for its variety of wildlife and is important conservation of Sri Lankan elephants, Sri Lankan leopards and aquatic birds.  </p><br>

            <p>Wilpattu National Park (Sinhala: ‡∑Ä‡∑í‡∂Ω‡∑ä‡∂¥‡∂≠‡∑ä‡∂≠‡∑î ‡∂¢‡∑è‡∂≠‡∑í‡∂ö ‡∑Ä‡∂±‡∑ù‡∂Ø‡∑ä‚Äç‡∂∫‡∑è‡∂±‡∂∫) is a national park in Sri Lanka. The unique feature of this park is the existence of "Willus" (natural lakes) ‚Äì natural, sand-rimmed water basins or depressions that fill with rainwater.
               Located on the northwest coast lowland dry zone of Sri Lanka, the park is 30 km (19 mi) west of Anuradhapura and 26 km (16 mi) north of Puttalam (approximately 180 km (110 mi) north of Colombo). 
              The park is 1,317 km2 (508 sq mi) (131,693 hectares) in area and ranges from 0‚Äì152 m (0‚Äì499 ft) above sea level.
               Nearly one hundred and six lakes (Willu) and tanks are found spread throughout Wilpattu.
               Wilpattu is the largest and one of the oldest national parks in Sri Lanka.
               Wilpattu is world-renowned for its leopard (Panthera pardus kotiya) population.
               A remote camera survey conducted in Wilpattu from July to October 2015 by the Wilderness and Wildlife Conservation Trust captured photographs of forty-nine individual leopards in the surveyed area, the core area density of which was between that of Yala National Park's Block I and Horton Plains National Park. </p><br>
