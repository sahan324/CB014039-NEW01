                 Block III (main gate in Galge area, on Buttala-Kataragama Road) and the adjoining Kumana Park or 'Yala East' (main gate at Okanda, on the east coast not far from Pottuvil) however are becoming popular in their own right too.<br><br>
                 Note that the Situlpahuwa pilgrimage site, geographically in Block III, has kind of an 'enclave' status and is accessible FOC through separate roads from Tissa and Kataragama. Most of the visitors stated that reasons for their visit is to see wild animals, and elephant is the most preferred animal.
                  The visitors like to see bears, leopards, birds as well.

                  The Yala National Park has been susceptible to terrorist attacks. 
                 On 17 October 2007 a group of LTTE cadres attacked an army detachment in Thalgasmankada in the park.
                  The attack killed six army soldiers and another was caught up in a landmine explosion.
                  On 11 July 2008 four people died in an attack launched by the LTTE.
                  The cadres opened fire at a bus carrying pilgrims to Kataragama.
                  Since the end of the civil war, May 2009, no violence has occurred in Yala area also and it is fully safe for visitors; this was also the main factor in opening blocks III and V for tourists.</p>
