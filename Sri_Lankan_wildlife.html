        <p>Wildlife refers to undomesticated animal species, but has come to include all organisms that grow or live wild in an area without being introduced by humans. 
          Wildlife was also synonymous to game: those birds and mammals that were hunted for sport.
           Wildlife can be found in all ecosystems.</p>

        <br>
        <p>Sinharaja Forest Reserve is a forest reserve and a biodiversity hotspot in Sri Lanka. It is of international significance and has been designated a Biosphere Reserve and World Heritage Site by UNESCO.

          According to International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), Sinharaja is the country's last viable area of primary tropical rainforest. More than 60% of the trees are endemic and many of them are considered rare. 50% of Sri Lankan's endemics species of animals (especially butterfly, amphibians, birds, snakes and fish species). It is home to 95% endemic birds.
          
          The hilly virgin rainforest, part of the Sri Lanka lowland rain forests ecoregion, was saved from the worst of commercial logging by its inaccessibility, and was designated a World Biosphere Reserve in 1978 and a World Heritage Site in 1988.
          
          Because of the dense vegetation, wildlife is not as easily seen as at dry-zone national parks such as Yala. The most common larger mammal is the endemic purple-faced langur.
          
          Birds tend to move in mixed feeding flocks, invariably led by the fearless Sri Lanka crested drongo and the noisy orange-billed babbler. Of Sri Lanka's 26 endemic birds, the 20 rainforest species all occur here, including the elusive red-faced malkoha, green-billed coucal and Sri Lanka blue magpie.
          
          Reptiles include the endemic green pit viper and hump-nosed vipers, and there are a large variety of amphibians, especially tree frogs. Invertebrates include the endemic Sri Lankan birdwing butterfly and leeches.<br>
          <br>The rainforest likely formed during the Jurassic period (from 200 million years to 145 million years ago). This forest encompasses an area of 36,000 hectares (88,960 acres/360 km¬≤).
          The reserve is only 21 km (13 mi) from east to west, and a maximum of 7 km (4.3 mi) from north to south, but it is a treasure trove of endemic species, including trees, insects, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals.
           Sinharaja forest vegetation density has been estimated at around 240,000 plants per hectare, the most dense rain forest in Asia. </p>

    <h1 class="headings11">02. Udawalawe National Park </h1>

      <div id="explain01">
        <br>
        <p>Udawalawe National Park is a national park on the boundary of Sabaragamuwa and Uva Provinces in Sri Lanka.
           The park was created to provide a sanctuary for wild animals displaced by the construction of the Udawalawe Reservoir on the Walawe River, as well as to protect the catchment of the reservoir. 
           The reserve covers 30,821 hectares (119.00 sq mi) of land area and was established on 30 June 1972.<br><br>

          Before the designation of the national park, the area was used for shifting cultivation (chena farming).
           The farmers were gradually removed once the national park was declared. The park is 165 kilometres (103 mi) from Colombo. Udawalawe is an important habitat for water birds and Sri Lankan elephants.
            It is a popular tourist destination and the third-most visited park in the country.<br><br>
            Elephants are Uda Walawe's key attraction, with around 600 in the park in herds of up to 50.
             There‚Äôs an elephant-proof fence around the perimeter of much of the park, (supposedly) preventing elephants from getting out into areas with a higher human population and cattle from getting in. 
             Elephants can and do migrate into and out of the park along unfenced borders.
              The best time to observe herds is from 6.30am to 10am and again from 4pm to 6.30pm.

            Alongside its famous elephant herds, the park is home to mongooses, jackals, water monitor lizards, lots of crocodiles, sloth bears and the occasional leopard. 
            There are 30 varieties of snake and a wealth of birdlife ‚Äì 210 species at last count; northern migrants join the residents between November and April. </p>
